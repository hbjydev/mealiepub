# Mealiepub

Mealiepub is a full-stack Next.js application that can put a public viewer over
your private Mealie instance. Good for using Mealie as a CMS and publishing
recipes in some form of browser. :)

It's designed to be deployed to Vercel and is very easily put up, you just need
a Mealie API key and the URL of your instance in your environment variables.
